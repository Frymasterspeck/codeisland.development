Input for the Elorza Transition

## Introduction

Mr. Mayor-elect and Transition Leaders, 

[Code Island](/index.html), Rhode Island's official [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) brigade, asks that you please accept this "friend of the court" brief on information technology development in the City of Providence. We very much appreciated [your complete and thoughtful reply](/candidate-questionnaire/responses/elorza) to our [Candidates Questionnaire](/candidate-questionnaire/) on open data and open government, and we hope that you can enact your agenda. As experienced practitioners, we know how very difficult that will be for your team. 

This brief seeks to advance what we consider best practices and to highlight specific areas where your administration can make an impact in the short term as well as areas where you can at last begin the process of building a meangful internal capacity.

Code Island is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to building [technology products[(/projects/index.html) that use open government data to solve problems for residents. We are an official "brigade" of Code for America, a national non-profit that supports this work. [Members](/members/index.html), nearly all of whom are full-time designers and developers, include three Open Providence Commissioners, RI's Chief Digital Officer, the City of Providence's civic innovation consultant and the Urban Information Specialist at Providence Plan.   

## First, Do No Harm

If you take one recommendation from this brief, let it be this: keep building momentum.
In general, the Taveras administration has improved the overall IT environment, but in no one area could we say that the city excels.
