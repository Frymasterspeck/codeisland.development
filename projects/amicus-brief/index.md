Input for the Elorza Transition

## Introduction

Mr. Mayor-elect and Transition Leaders, 

[Code Island](/index.html), Rhode Island's official [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) brigade, asks that you please accept this "friend of the court" brief on information technology development in the City of Providence. We very much appreciated [your complete and thoughtful reply](/candidate-questionnaire/responses/elorza) to our [Candidates Questionnaire](/candidate-questionnaire/) on open data and open government, and we hope that you can enact your agenda. As experienced practitioners, we know how very difficult that will be for your team. 

Code Island is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to building [technology products[(/projects/index.html) that use open government data to solve problems for residents. We are an official "brigade" of Code for America, a national non-profit that supports this work. [Members](/members/index.html), nearly all of whom are full-time designers and developers, include three Open Providence Commissioners, RI's Chief Digital Officer, the City of Providence's civic innovation consultant, the Urban Information Specialist at Providence Plan, member of the RI Office of Management and Budget and members of RI.gov, developers of the state's award-winning websites.   

This brief seeks to advance what we consider best practices and to highlight specific areas where your administration can make an impact in the short term as well as areas where you can at last begin the process of building a meangful internal capacity.

## There's a Long Way to Go

If you take one recommendation from this brief, let it be this: keep building momentum. 

Despite recent improvements, Providence remains well behind its peers in the information tools it uses. This includes tools used within the government as well as those used to communicate with residents and businesses. To count your administration a success in this area, your team will need not just to continue improvements, but to accelerate the pace. 

In general, the Taveras administration has improved the overall IT environment, but in no one area could we say that the city excels. We feel that all the new initiatives should continue with greater emphasis on bringing meaningful datasets into the open. 

That's easy to say, but hard to do. Each topic below suggests ways that your administration can help the city build an information technology structure that this process easier.

## Allocation

In your questionnaire responses, you expressed reluctance to increase the budget for IT. While your reasons are strong, we ask that you reconsider this based on the city's historical under-investment. Current inefficiencies likely cost the city more in a month than would doubling the IT budget for the year. The city needs first to invest in the replacement systems before it can reap the benefits of lower costs across the board.  Holding the budget flat only prolongs time until the modern systems the city so desperately needs are put in place. 

The simplest way to understand the enormity of the problem is to consider that some cities have been accepting in-person credit card payments for two decades or more, but Providence does not. A city with a significant deficit should not make it difficult itself to receive income, yet a city with deficits also lacks funds to invest in solving the problem.

We acknowledge the difficulties the city and the administration face, and we would be happy to work with the city to develop metrics that demonstrate the ROI of increased IT spending. 

## Make Every Dollar Count

Instead of increasing the IT budget, your questionnaire response suggested "cost-neutral" changes to deliver better services with the same amount of money. We believe that different spending patterns could create substantial impacts in the quality of services, in the effectiveness of government and in the economy as a whole. 

Most of the city's discretionary IT spending goes to the wrong place: elsewhere. Very little of this budget goes to local and regional contractors, and we recommend changing this as appropriate. When the city must work with far-off vendors, it should avoid "vendor lock in" by selecting vendors that support open standards.
